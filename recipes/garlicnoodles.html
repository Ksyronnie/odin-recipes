    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>For the Secret Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Noodles:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Gather all ingredients. Stir soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl for the secret sauce.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Quickly stir in the secret sauce and turn off the heat.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet slightly firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Transfer spaghetti into the sauce using tongs, bringing some of the cooking water with it. Toss until well coated; stir in Parmesan cheese. Splash in more pasta water if noodles are too dry.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Plate noodles; garnish with green onions and red pepper flakes.
